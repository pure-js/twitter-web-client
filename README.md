# Twitter web client

## The Task

A single-page application that, using the Twitter API, retrives 101 tweets using the specified hashtag.
Organize the recieved tweets into an adaptive grid.
If the tweet has a background, you need to add it as background to the cell.

## Specification

Breakpoints: 360, 720, 1024, 1366.
Don't use CSS frameworks and off-the-shelf solutions.
Use javascript, html, css. (Preprocessors for almost anything are welcomed)
Pay attention to semantics and code readability.

## Notes

- Demonstration of the OOP of the brain (Did you hear about Abstract Factory pattern?)
- Do you know how to use CSS flexible boxes? Wonderful, use them all.
- Names of CSS selectors you choose consciously and can argue your choice? An additional plus.
- Did you love CSS transformations, transitions, web animation to the state of epilepsy? We too. Feel free to use them to improve the user experience.
- Header in header of header don't confuse you? Show how deep the rabbit hole of HTML5 semantic is, feel free to use all the new tags you've read about.
